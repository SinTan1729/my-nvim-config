# My NeoVim Config Files

This is basically a collection of copies of `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim` from all my
machines. The `laptop` one is the most comprehensive, the others are basically
subsets of it.

Feel free to use it for configuring your [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
installation the way you like it.
